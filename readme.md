# coderheck's/longnuub's/loxzyioxzy's nvim configs
so imagine: you are a programmer whose old laptop is a damn toaster which cannot run the bloated mess that is vscode, you just bought a new laptop which has the best Performance Gains (ðŸ¤‘) you've had in a LOOOONG time. but then you realize since you couldnt run vscode you had to switch to neovim and you had the most crowded, most chaotic, most BLOATED piece of a init.lua that is and you just FORGOT to copy that init file somewhere before FORMATTING the old laptop's hard drives, and now you cant use neovim like you did before, you cant switch back to vscode too since Muscle Memory. Hell Nah. truly the most nightmarish scenario a programmer can imagine of. \
thats why syncing one's neovim configs is a common practice (i think so (source: i made it up, probably is true tho, idk)) and here lies my bloated `init.lua`, full of useless stuff (along with the lazy.nvim installation LOL i cant be bothered with it anyways)
# install
well i mean you do know how to clone this repo right \
just clone it into your %localappdata% or whatever on linux or macos (i dont use these OSes) and it should be working fine
# afterwords
why did i make this readme.md? i dont even know its 12am where i live and apparently i was high enough to write this all out \
so yeah, have fun coding and whatever
